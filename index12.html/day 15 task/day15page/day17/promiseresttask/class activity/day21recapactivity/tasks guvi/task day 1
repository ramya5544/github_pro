Difference between HTTP 1.1 VS HTTP 2:

    Http 1.1:
      Http 1.1 it used one tcp connection after that small improvement after six tcp connection be used.
     Internet landscape was constantly changing with websites becoming more dynamic and heavy.
     Repetition of header data and it can be more focus on gzip,minifying css/js,catching .
     Client request and server request these are limited.and it is a stateless protocol.
      Re using of the same tcp connection for multiple http request.

 HTTP 2:
      One secured tcp connections is setup in which Http request are transferred in form of streams.
       Stream are connected to different request.Hpack data is added on http2.
       Hpack data is separate from request data and can be zipped.it enables reuse of header data which is repeated in every request.
       Hpack reduces http request size. And its fastest data delivery.
       Push frames enables us to send mandatory resources along with an Http response.
